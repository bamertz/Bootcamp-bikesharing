## Summary

The total number of users in August for CitiBike is over 2.3 Million. This creates a compelling argument for investors to look at bikesharing in other cities. Next, we analyzed the Peak User Hours in August we can see that most users use Bike Sharing between 6-10pm. Digging deeper, we analyzed the average trip duration per user and then again by gender. We can see that most users, male or female, use bikesharing for 15 minutes or less. We can also see that males used CitiBike a lot more than females.

Combining the data above with the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour and the Trips by Gender By Weekday For Each Hour we can see that the most common users are Males on weekdays between 6-9am and again 4-8pm. This corresponds with start/stop times of work.

One visualization that would be helpful to Investors would be Usage over several months. I imagine usage slows drastically in winter months. Another visualization that would be helpful is a percentage Bike Friendly streets in Des Moines compared to NYC.
